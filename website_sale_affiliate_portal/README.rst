===============================
 Website sale affiliate portal
===============================

This module allows your affiliate partners to connect to your website
and see a report of their affiliate requests.


Usage
=====

Setup an affiliation associated to a partner, which user has the
portal permissions.

When the partner logs into the portal, it sees a new "Your
Affiliations" section, provided by present module. It links to a page
with all the affiliations that concern it and which have less than 6
month-old affiliate requests.

For each displayed affiliation, a monthly report is available, with
the total gains per affiliation and per product.


Roadmap
=======

It would be interesting to let partners download the complete
affiliate request list as a CSV file or can be presented a shiny
filterable d3js-based graph.
