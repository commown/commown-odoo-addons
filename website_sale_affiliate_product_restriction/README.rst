============================================
 Website sale affiliate product restriction
============================================

This module makes it possible to restrict your affiliation to an
optional choice of products. When such a product restriction is set up
for a given affiliate, sales coming from this affiliates will only be
considered if they concern one of the listed products.


Usage
=====

When setting up an affiliation, a list of product templates can be
chosen in a dedicated field. Leave the field empty if you do not want
to restrict the list of product to consider in the affiliation.
