=====================================
 Commown self-troubleshooting module
=====================================

This module is used by portal users to self-troubleshoot their
device(s).


Usage
=====

There is a link to the self-troubleshooting tool in portal users'
home. The tool guides them towards a solution to their problem by
asking them questions in a wizard-like form, which ends-up by the
creation of a ready-to-handle issue in the support project.


Configuration
=============

There is no special configuration to use the module. It is however
highly customizable as the created views are designed to be easily
editable:

- webpage views
