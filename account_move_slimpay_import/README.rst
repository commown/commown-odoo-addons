===========================
Account Move Slimpay Import
===========================

This module will import your slimpay statement (called report in their
Web UI) as account moves before the reconciliation.

Slimpay API does not make it possible to import these reports
automatically so you will have to download them manually in the CSV
format and upload them to ODOO.


Configuration
=============

Then create a new journal for importing the payment:

#. Go to Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Journals
